SureBid x Sanctum Gateway: Reliable Solana auctions with multi-path delivery.

What we built:
- On-chain auction (Anchor) with escrow PDA
- Gateway integration: build + send with routing controls
- LiveTxFeed + Admin tuning + Metrics (refunds, latency, failures)

Results (devnet):
- Failed tx rate â†“
- Median confirmation time <5s (settlement)
- Refunds when RPC lands (Jito tip saved)
